										<h4>Discuss how differently social media shape the view of people towards beauty.</h4>
										<h6></h6>
										<p style="font-size: larger; color: #414141;">
											Due to the rise in popularity of social media sites, allowing us to post photos to share online, I do think that it altered people’s conception about beauty standards. People always tend to upload their best photo as their profile picture; some do it to receive positive reactions from their peers, some just don’t want to be judged or criticized for their looks. Since we are constantly being updated about peer’s new ‘attractive’ posts, we tend to sometimes compare ourselves to them, and then eventually feel worse about our own image. Some people or most resort to using filters in their photographs in order to enhance their appearance to feel better about themselves or just to not feel worse. I do think that people are now even more pressured to look good due to the unattainable standards of beauty in social media, and it is causing a negative impact when people feel forced to try to change themselves to fit society's image.

									<h4>In your own observation these days, do you think credit card is a need or want? Discuss your answer.</h4>
									<p style="font-size: larger; color: #f2f2f2;">
										I do think that having a credit card is a want and not a need, since I think it is more for convenience purposes rather than a necessity, personally I have not experienced having a credit card, I could see that it could be very useful for purchasing thing especially in online stores, but it could be equally disadvantageous if you tend to spend above your means, which may cause debt.

										<h4>
											Summarize the lesson on how you understand sexual selves develop through an interactionist perspective.
										</h4>
										<h6></h6>
										<p style="font-size: larger; color: #414141;">
											From what I understood, our sexual selves are developed starting childhood, when we were a child; we understood that we are gendered through social interactions with adults.  For instance, if you are a boy, you are presented with masculine toys like robots and if you are a girl, you were given things that are feminine such as dolls. As an individual grows, he or she gains more understanding about gender differences which helps him/her to navigate a gendered social world. We also realize that there are things regarding our sexuality that are allowed and prohibited or should be withheld.
